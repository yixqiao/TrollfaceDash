# TrollfaceDash
A silly, frustrating, almost-condescending platformer game made a long time ago in the era of trollfaces and MLG memes.  
I made this (as previously stated) a very long time ago and the code is probably horrible. Artistic choices could also have been better.  
Please don't think too much of it.  
I will admit that I had a decent amount of fun playing it.
